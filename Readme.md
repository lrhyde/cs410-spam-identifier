# Bot Detection Dataset 🤖🔍

Welcome to the Bot Detection Dataset! This dataset is designed to facilitate the analysis and detection of bot accounts on Twitter. It contains a collection of user profiles and associated tweet data, along with a binary label indicating whether each user is a bot or not.

## Dataset Information 📊

The dataset is provided in a CSV file format named 'bot_detection_dataset.csv'. It includes the following columns:

- User ID: Unique identifier for each user in the dataset.
- Username: The username associated with the user.
- Tweet: The text content of the tweet.
- Retweet Count: The number of times the tweet has been retweeted.
- Mention Count: The number of mentions in the tweet.
- Follower Count: The number of followers the user has.
- Verified: A boolean value indicating whether the user is verified or not.
- Bot Label: A label indicating whether the user is a bot (1) or not (0).
- Location: The location associated with the user.
- Created At: The date and time when the tweet was created.
- Hashtags: The hashtags associated with the tweet.

## How to Use 📝

1. Load the dataset: Read the 'bot_detection_dataset.csv' file into your preferred data analysis or machine learning tool/library.
2. Preprocess the data: Perform any necessary data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
3. Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm: Select one or more algorithms suitable for binary classification, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.
5. Train the model: Train the chosen algorithm(s) on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. Predict Bot or Not: Apply the trained model to new data to predict whether a user is a bot or not.

## ML Algorithms for Bot Detection 🧠💡
